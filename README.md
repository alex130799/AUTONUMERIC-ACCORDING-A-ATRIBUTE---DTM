# AUTONUMERIC-ACCORDING-A-ATRIBUTE-DTM

The output of Mineable Shape Optimizer(MSO) give us stopes with a STOPENUM atribute as code of them. In the practices a Planning - Mining Engineer only select a part of all stopes to evaluate reserves, in this point the engineer needs to sort the selected stopes in a order, easer to report. This Java code attemp to give ordered atribute according with a other atribute that identify the interesting zone. 

# OVERVIEW

 . Insight of output of MSO.
 
 . Issue of STOPENUM in a interesting zone.
 
 . Script View in Datamine Software
 
 . Comparation between before and after stope identification.
 
 # INSIGHT OF OUTPUT OF MSO
 
 Mineable Shape Optimizer allow join many block into a stopes that accomplish the cut off. Theses Stopes have measures according to given setup previously.

#####  NOTE: THOSES NUMBERS IDENTIFY THE STOPENUM OF EACH STOPES

 # ISSUE OF STOPENUM IN A INTERESTING ZONE

To report reserve, mining engineer needs to give a code each stope accomplish a numeric order of interesting zone. The STOPENUM CODE doesn't this requirement because of STOPENUM identify all stopes and not the interesting zone.
